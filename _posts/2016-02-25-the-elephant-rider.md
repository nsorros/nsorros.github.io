Your brain consists of two main parts. The prefrontal cortex which is responsible for our conscious thoughts and distinguishes us from other animals and the cerebral cortex which is in charge of our unconscious self.

To better understand the size and control we have over our unconsciousness think of a person riding an elephant. The person in our analogue is the conscious self while the elephant is the unconscious self.
 
At most times a trained rider can easily control the movement of the elephant which resembles everyday life.

But what happens when a mouse suddenly appears in from of the animal? The elephant gets panicky and the rider has almost no way to control him.

This is what happens when we do stuff we regret or even worse when we get a panic attack. Our conscious self loses the control.
