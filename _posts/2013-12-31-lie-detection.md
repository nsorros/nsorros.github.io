Lie detection is a project I was working on while I was a research assistant at Imperial College.
  
The goal of the project was to produce non obtrusive ways to measure the physiological responses that are associated with deceptive behavior.
  
More specifically I used Computer Vision to build a blink detection algorithm since blinkinkg patterns have been shown to be predictive of whether a person lies.
  
More details and code is also coming soon...
