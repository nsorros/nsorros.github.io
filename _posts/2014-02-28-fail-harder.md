## Fail harder, the value of a big failure

It was during a presentation from facebook when I first heard the quote ‘Fail harder’ and I remember it puzzled me for the rest of the talk. 
The reason I was puzzled was because most people, including myself, tend to fail pretty safely and since even these failures are not easy to accept, 
I could not think why I would want to fail harder than that.
During the talk the speaker kept mentioning examples of facebook failures that have turned up into big lessons, 
like the timeline. The point he was trying to make was that if you are failing safe it means you are not moving 
fast enough, you are not making enough mistakes from which you can learn and essentially you are not innovating.
After the talk was finished I kept thinking whether the guy was right or it was just a marketing trick to get us 
hooked and convince us they are cool and unconventional. 
I was wondering, “Why fail?”, “Why not fail safe?”, “What is the value of a big failure?”

## Why fail?

There are a number of reasons why it is good to occasionally fail but I think the most important are the lessons learned after each failure.
Job seeking is a great example of the iterative process that happens every time you fail to get a job.
You apply for a job, your CV gets rejected, you realise you have to tailor it for the application, 
you apply again and you are given a test this time that you fail, you realise you need to practise for the test, 
next time you pass to the final stage and you realise you didn’t do your homework for the company or for the technical questions. 
After some iterations you land with one job offer or more. Job seeking may be a specific case but this iterative 
process accompanies most situations where we fail and forces us to improve ourselves through the received feedback.

## Why not fail safe?

Ok, failures can be beneficial but are certainly painful so why not try to make the most out of the situation? Why not fail safe and take the lessons learned in the most cheap way? Lets switch to another example, college applications. When you apply for undergraduate or postgraduate studies you usually deploy your fail safe strategy by applying to both a university it is hard to get into and to one that will probably grant you an offer. The problem that arises in such situations is that you will probably end up with an offer and you will most likely ignore the failures. Even if you don’t, understanding the reasons is not a straightforward process and it usually comes with time and experience.

## The value of a big failure

But what if you fail all your applications (happened to me a few years back) ? That is definitely not a fail safe scenario. Having no offers for next year you will have plenty of time to think but you will probably need a lot less than that. This is because the feedback this time is more clear. You know that something is wrong with your application and you are certainly more willing to work on improving it than before. In addition you have a limited time window to capitalise on your improvements, since the next application period is probably going to start in approximately 6 months, if not sooner, since you received your last rejection.
The difference from the fail safe scenario is huge. Failing harder not only minimised the time spent to identify areas and things you need to work on, it also accelerated the process of improvement.
Failing harder gives you the opportunity to move fast, not only as a company, but also as a person. Failing more means you are learning more and learning more means you are succeeding more.
