### Experience
  
**Data scientist @ 6tribes**
*January 2015 - Present(1 year 3 months)*

People is the most important thing in our lives and yet 1 in 5 people report feeling lonely. My mission in
6 tribes was to remove the friction from finding and connecting with people that share your interests and views. How?

* by creating a personality profile of a user from their Facebook data and matching them with the most similar user or group of users.
* by recommending other users or group of users with similar behavior within the app. # by analysing users behaviors within the app in order to increase D1 retention.
* by profiling our users to fine tune our marketing campaigns.
* by building an inviting mechanism
both within the app and the web.
* by building a dashboard displaying our key performance indicators. Similarity search, Recommenders, Feature engineering,
