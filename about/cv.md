## Summary
  
Data scientist with a mission to use data driven approaches to maximise happiness.  
Why happiness? Because happy users translate to a great company and not the other way around.  
Love to brainstorm, discuss and prototype ideas to test a hypothesis.
  
## Experience
  
**Data scientist @ 6tribes**  
*January 2015 - Present(1 year 3 months)*

People is the most important thing in our lives and yet 1 in 5 people report feeling lonely. My mission in
6 tribes was to remove the friction from finding and connecting with people that share your interests and views. How?

* by creating a personality profile of a user from their Facebook data and matching them with the most similar user or group of users.
* by recommending other users or group of users with similar behavior within the app. # by analysing users behaviors within the app in order to increase D1 retention.
* by profiling our users to fine tune our marketing campaigns.
* by building an inviting mechanism
both within the app and the web.
* by building a dashboard displaying our key performance indicators. Similarity search, Recommenders, Feature engineering,

Technologies used while working with:  
Backend: Scala, Slick, Play, Akka, Jenkins, Git  
Data science: Python, Elasticsearch, Flask, CircleCI, Git  
Marketing: Facebook ads, Google Analytics, Heap Analytics  
Product: Slack, Trello, Geckoboard  
  
**Data scientist @ Conversocial**  
*August 2014 - January 2015 (6 months)*  
  
Customer service is the brand of the company. Conversocial's mission is to remove the friction from
connecting with the companies you user as a customer by providing an intuitive SaaS platform to address customer inquiries coming from social media. My role in Conversocial involved:  
  
* creating a data warehouse in PostgreSQL for product and marketing analytics
* maintaining a filtering classifier to separate customer service inquiries from noise
* builded a language detector for Conversocial Crowds, a crowdsource customer service solution
* proposed to implement a prioritisation engine to rank the inquiries from most to least important
* proposed to implement automated responses to speed up the resolution of customer inquiries

**Software engineer @ Factset**  
*January 2014 - July 2014 (7 months)*  
  
When I joined Factset, the company was in the middle of an architectural shift. Linux was replacing OpenVMS in the servers, a new more resilient, fault-tolerant and scalable version of Factset in-house database called FDB was replacing the previous version and finally teams were working towards replacing their ETL tools by the in-house NGen tool which was better performing and well suited for Factset use case.  
  
Soon after I joined the Mutual Funds team I realised that most of these migrations could be automated with some bash and python scripting which I proposed and started working on right away resulting in more than 5 successful migration over the period of 6 months (up from an average of 2 before I joined).  

During my time in Factset I became really interested in the development of our in house ETL tool, NGen which was written in C++ and shipped two changes in production while learning how the internals were working. It was also during this time that I realised the importance of well written code while refactoring a 10 years old ETL system written in Perl, which for the last 5 years everyone was avoiding to touch and reducing the time it took to complete from around 24 hours to 3 hours. On my spare time I worked out a proposal on ingesting social media data in our database, starting with twitter, for those companies that Factset's clients were mostly interested in and something that Bloomberg (Factset main competitor) has introduced 6 months ago.

**Research assistant @ Imperial College**  
*October 2013 - December 2013 (3 months)*  
  
60% of people can't have a 10 minute conversation without lying at least once. While white lies are necessary
to every day life, other types of lies can have financial and even tragical consequences like terrorism. Unfortunately humans are not better than randomness in predicting whether someone is lying. Our best effort so far has been a century old solution better known as polygraph. Polygraph accuracy is significantly higher than chance but still way below perfect with the exact accuracy ranging from study to study.  
  
My research in Imperial focused in non obtrusive methods to capture physiological cues of human deception. The area around the eyes exposes some of those responses that seem to originate from the sympathetic nervous system, which makes them hard to control. Examples are the temperature around the eyes, the blinking duration and frequency and the pupil size but not the gaze of your eyes which is a common misbelief. As part of my research I developed a blink detector with a 95% accuracy in an ethnically diverse database in a less controlled environment.
