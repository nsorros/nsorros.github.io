### Experience
  
**Data scientist @ 6tribes**  
*January 2015 - Present(1 year 3 months)*

People is the most important thing in our lives and yet 1 in 5 people report feeling lonely. My mission in
6 tribes was to remove the friction from finding and connecting with people that share your interests and views. How?

* by creating a personality profile of a user from their Facebook data and matching them with the most similar user or group of users.
* by recommending other users or group of users with similar behavior within the app. # by analysing users behaviors within the app in order to increase D1 retention.
* by profiling our users to fine tune our marketing campaigns.
* by building an inviting mechanism
both within the app and the web.
* by building a dashboard displaying our key performance indicators. Similarity search, Recommenders, Feature engineering,

**Software engineer @ Factset**  
*January 2014 - July 2014 (7 months)*  
  
When I joined Factset, the company was in the middle of an architectural shift. Linux was replacing OpenVMS in the servers, a new more resilient, fault-tolerant and scalable version of Factset in-house database called FDB was replacing the previous version and finally teams were working towards replacing their ETL tools by the in-house NGen tool which was better performing and well suited for Factset use case.  
  
Soon after I joined the Mutual Funds team I realised that most of these migrations could be automated with some bash and python scripting which I proposed and started working on right away resulting in more than 5 successful migration over the period of 6 months (up from an average of 2 before I joined).  

During my time in Factset I became really interested in the development of our in house ETL tool, NGen which was written in C++ and shipped two changes in production while learning how the internals were working. It was also during this time that I realised the importance of well written code while refactoring a 10 years old ETL system written in Perl, which for the last 5 years everyone was avoiding to touch and reducing the time it took to complete from around 24 hours to 3 hours. On my spare time I worked out a proposal on ingesting social media data in our database, starting with twitter, for those companies that Factset's clients were mostly interested in and something that Bloomberg (Factset main competitor) has introduced 6 months ago.
