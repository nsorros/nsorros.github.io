I am Nick Sorros and I am a Data Scientist specialising in Natural Language Processing.

I have be working as a Data Scientist for the last 10 years. First in various London startups
such as [Conversocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversocial), 6tribes and [Seedrs](https://www.seedrs.com/) and then as a manager of the data science team at
the Wellcome Trust.

During my career I have be working mainly on Natural Language Processing problems which is what
led me to found [MantisNLP](https://mantisnlp.com/), a remote first NLP consultancy.

I am a fan of open source code, put an emphasis on reproducibility of data science work and care 
about the ethics of our work.

In my free time I co organise the [PyData meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Cyprus/) in Cyprus and I am also part of the scoping committee
of [DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/).

I am also interested in coffee ☕️, cooking 🥘 and cycling 🚴🏻
