Nick has been working as a data scientist for the last 10 years. Prior to setting up MantisNLP, he was working for the Wellcome Trust, initially to set up and lead the data science team. Prior to that he worked for a couple of startups at different stages of maturity from few to dozens of employees in various sectors such as fintech and social networks. Before data science, Nick was studying and doing research at Imperial College.

During these years in the industry Nick found himself working more and more in NLP problems from detecting the language of tweets and identifying which entrepreneur statements were factual to tagging grants with thousands of labels and finding references in policy documents. This led him to create MantisNLP, a data science consultancy focused on NLP with a remote first culture and client worldwide.
