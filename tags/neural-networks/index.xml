Unsurprisingly then, we decided to use a neural network as the modelling approach for tagging our grants with MeSH. Neural networks have raised the state of the art performance on the task to 71% from below 60%. Understandably neural networks may feel complicated to someone outside the field of machine learning, but in this piece my goal is to make them as understandable as logistic regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</description></item></channel></rss>
