title: My life so far ...

<h1> Hello,</h1>
<p>
	My story starts in Greece where I was born and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering.
	My interest in <u>machine learning and affective computing</u> led me to Imperial College
	where under the guidance of Prof. Maja Pantic I conducted research around the emotional and physiological responses
	of deceptive behaviour through video and speech.
</p>

<p>
	During the transition from academia to work I started suffering from <b>panic attacks</b> something that completely altered my <u>understanding of life</u>. 
	As I was dealing with that problem I embarked on a journey to rediscover myself and the meaning of life. 
	As part of that journey I started meditating, practicing yoga, doing psychotherapy and reading about happiness and positive psychology. 
</p>

<p>
	I realised that this journey is <u>not about the destination, it is about the ride</u>. 
	This journey also has a name, it is called life. And life is the journey of knowing yourself, 
	knowing what makes you happy and unhappy along with a mission or purpose which is shaped throughout living this life. 
	In that sense my mission was obvious and it was to learn more about our emotional wellbeing and use my knowledge to design products to allow people to live a happier and more fulfilling life.
</p>

<p>
	As a <b>data scientist</b> I am both a user and a designer of the technologies we use everyday.
	Having being <u>addicted to technology</u> myself, I have experienced the emotional impact that technology has to our life.
</p>
<p>
	This led me to my <b>first goal</b> which is to promote a more <u>conscious use of technology</u>.
