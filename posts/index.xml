As a builder of these digital products, my team and I have to consider the unintended consequences they may have on users and on society more broadly. We know this is important because of famous cases where the consequences werenâ€™t considered and harm has been done. For example the Google photos tagging system and Amazon hiring algorithm that have been accused of unintended racist and sexist bias.</description></item><item><title>To Predict or to Explain</title><link>https://nsorros.github.io/posts/to-predict-or-to-explain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 10:10:30 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://nsorros.github.io/posts/to-predict-or-to-explain/</guid><description>As data scientists, our day job is around modelling. We create models to recommend new products, to increase conversion rates, to explain user behaviour etc. And depending on your background, it is more likely to be familiar either with machine learning techniques or regression type analysis. It is the difference among these two distinct approaches in modelling that motivated me to write this post which is a summary of a talk I gave recently in PyData London.</description></item></channel></rss>
